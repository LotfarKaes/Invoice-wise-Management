-	PHP 
-	MySQL Database Server 
-	SCSS files which are used to build the *.css files
-	Layout files which are used with the Angular Material (Flexbox) Layout API.

# Installation
This is a web based solution that needs its relevant files to exist on the web server. The files can be copied to the web server by extracting the download package on your computer and uploading its contents to the web server via FTP, or by copying the download package to the web server directly and extracting its contents there. The contents of the download package need to be copied to the public HTML directory in the web server it is serving from. Examples of public HTML directories are: 
• /home/invoicewisemanagement/public_html/ 
• /srv/www/htdocs/ 
• /usr/local/htdocs/ 
• /var/www/vhosts/ invoicewisemanagement /httpdocs/
